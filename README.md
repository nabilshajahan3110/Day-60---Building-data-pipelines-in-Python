## Day-60---Building-data-pipelines-in-Python
As part of a 75-day data analysis challenge, this work on Python covers building data pipelines in Python

Building data pipelines in Python refers to creating a series of processes to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data efficiently. A data pipeline automates the flow of data from one system to another, ensuring it is collected, processed, and stored in a way that makes it ready for analysis, reporting, or further use.

### Key Components of a Data Pipeline:

**Extraction:**

Fetching data from various sources such as databases, APIs, files (e.g., CSV, JSON, Excel), web scraping, or streaming data sources.

**Common Python libraries for extraction:**

requests, BeautifulSoup for web scraping.
pandas, pyodbc, SQLAlchemy for database extraction.
boto3 for fetching data from AWS services like S3.

**Transformation:**

Cleaning, filtering, aggregating, or modifying data to make it usable and consistent.
This might include removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing formats, or performing calculations.

**Common Python libraries for transformation:**

pandas for data manipulation.
NumPy for numerical transformations.
PySpark for large-scale data processing.
re for regular expression-based text transformations.

**Loading:**

Storing the transformed data into a target destination like a database, data warehouse, file system, or cloud storage.

**Common Python libraries for loading:**

pandas, SQLAlchemy for writing data to databases.
boto3 for cloud storage.
openpyxl, csv for saving to files.
